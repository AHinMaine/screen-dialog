# This is the main list of hosts read by the s-dialog
# script.  Order is preserved so if you want to sort these
# entries differently, you to do it manually here.
#
# The s-dialog script is fairly flexible in what format it
# will parse.
#
#   plain hostsname:
#       server01.example.com
#
#   hostname with username:
#       user@server01.example.com
#
#   hostname with username and a tag comment:
#       user@server01.example.com # mail server
#
#   hostname and port with username and a tag comment:
#       user@servertest01.example.com:2222 # lab server
#
#
# However, entry names are first checked in dispatch table
# near the top of the s-dialog script.  If there's a match,
# instead of assuming that this is a host and opening an ssh
# window, it will execute the code reference found in the
# dispatch table.  The first 10 of these items are examples
# that will use the dispatch table.
